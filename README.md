Certainly! This project aims to develop a system that can help people who are visually impaired to understand their surroundings by converting images into text and then into voice commands.
The system is based on two types of deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The CNNs are used to analyze and process the images, while the LSTM models are used to generate the corresponding text based on the visual information.
Once the image is converted to text, the system uses text-to-speech technology to convert the text into spoken words.
